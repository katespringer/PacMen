# PacMen

## Description: 
A PacMan "factory" created with JavaScript and HTML with the following features: 
- When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman appears at a random position on the screen. 
- When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen start moving at random velocity on the screen.
- When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it changes position to stay within the page.

## How to Run:
Download files and drag index.html to your browser. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
- For each PacMan added, a ghost is also added that chases them.
